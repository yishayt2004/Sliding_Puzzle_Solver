# Sliding Puzzle Solver

This project presents a Python implementation of a sliding puzzle game along with a solver algorithm, all wrapped up in a sleek Pygame interface. The game allows players to interactively solve the puzzle or sit back and watch the solver algorithm do its magic.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users can move tiles around using arrow keys or let the solver find the optimal solution.
- **Solver Algorithm:** Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to efficiently find the shortest path to solving the puzzle.
- **Dynamic UI:** The Pygame interface provides an intuitive user experience with responsive buttons and colorful tile graphics.
- **Randomized Boards:** Generates solvable puzzle configurations for endless replayability.

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to move tiles in the desired direction.
- Click "Redraw" to shuffle the puzzle tiles.
- Click "Solve" to watch the solver algorithm in action.

## Next Steps
1. **Offer Hints:** Provide hints to the user, allowing them to see the next step of the solution if desired.
2. **Confirm Give Up:** Display a dialog box when the "Resolve" button is clicked, asking the user if they are sure they want to give up.
3. **Statistics Export:** Collect user input (e.g., name) and offer to export puzzle-solving statistics as a document at the end of each session.
4. **Difficulty Levels:** Introduce difficulty levels to customize the puzzle challenge.

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** Leveraging the versatile language for game logic and algorithm implementation.
- **Pygame:** Powering the graphical user interface and event handling for smooth interactions.
- **Git:** Utilizing version control for collaborative development and project management.
